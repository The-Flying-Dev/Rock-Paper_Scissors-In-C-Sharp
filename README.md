<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A Rock Paper Scissors console game. In this program the player will choose either Rock, Paper or Scissors and compare their choice to the AI (it's actually just a While Loop that increments an Integer variable based on the switch statement results). The first player to reach 3 points wins!
The following topics are covered: `User Input`, `Random Object`, `While loops`, `Logical Operators` and `Conditional Statements`.
